# agricultureML
A DataCamp Project that i completed and was my first step into the ML world. 
I managed to achieve this project by completing the course "Supervised  Learning with skikit-learn"
this course  allowed me to learn the specefics of Supervised learning and all about the scikit-learn framework in python which in return allowed me to view all the possibilities and capabilities of ML. 
Below is the description of the problem. 

A farmer reached out to me as a machine learning expert seeking help to select the best crop for his field. Due to budget constraints, the farmer explained that he could only afford to measure two out of the four essential soil measures:

Nitrogen content ratio in the soil
Phosphorous content ratio in the soil
Potassium content ratio in the soil
pH value of the soil
I realized that this is a classic feature selection problem, where the objective is to pick the most important features that could help predict the crop accurately.
